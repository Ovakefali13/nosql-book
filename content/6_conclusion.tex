\chapter{Conclusion}

With detailed assessments of several \gls{nosql} database implementations, this
book aimed to answer the research question \textit{"What are the
characteristics of today's popular (Open Source) \gls{nosql} databases in
relation to the CAP theorem?"}. For this, a detailed introduction to
wide-column-store, several key-value databases, document stores and graph
databases was given.

It is now clear that for no database implementation one can absolutely state
that the CAP theorem can be applied. While always some parts of the theorem
apply to the different implementations, as stated by the CAP literature itself,
not all aspects can be realized. Though one interesting result is that all
database implementations aim to be partition tolerant. It was furthermore shown
that RethinkDB as well as Couchbase are \textit{available}, whereas the rest
strives towards consistency.

The work of this book is limited by the fact that the research in most fields
is not up-to-date and literature is in some cases already deprecated. In
addition to that, only free versions of the specific database implementations
could be considered, which limits the final statement and answer of the
research question.

Further work could include a new and more recent benchmark, including current
problem sets. A unified benchmark with which all database implementations could
be compared would be of immense value to the field of \gls{nosql} databases.
